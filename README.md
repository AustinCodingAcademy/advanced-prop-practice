#### Intro
This project is where we can practice working with component props or properties. We have learned what props are, now we need to be able to write the code for it. Many different things can be given as the value of a prop. Hard coded object literals can cause confusion because of the curly braces. Sometime you need curly braces, sometimes you don't. We also need to be able to interpret instructions that may use different terminology. What does "send in a prop" or "give it a prop" mean?
#### Setup
Fork, clone, npm install, npm start, pull request
#### Do
 *  We are going to use our SuperComponent which is capable of accepting many different props 
 *  Follow the commented instructions in App.js telling you what prop to send in to SuperComponent
 *  Make sure everything shows up on screen as expected
